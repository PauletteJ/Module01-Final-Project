# Movie Genre Analysis

## Introduction

The premise of this project is that Microsoft has decided to start a movie studio, and they need to determine what the best kind of movie to make is. This project will analyze the best grossing movies for 2019, 2020, and all time, and break them down by genre, the number of genres they fit, and MPAA rating to determine they type of movie Microsoft should focus their production on.

## The Dataset

Movie grosses, MPAA ratings, and genres were pulled from BoxOffice Mojo. They movies were compared on their domestic gross.

Data were collected from the Box Office Mojo web site. The movies selected were the top 200 movies of three lists: all time grossing movies, highest grossing movies of 2019 and highest grossing movies of 2020. I kept the lists of 2019 and 2020 to 200 movies since movies below that generated small enough revenue ($2.2 million and $150,000 respectively) that they would not be of interest to a major player in the movie industry. The resulting set was a total of 551 movies.

Movies were compared on genre, number of genres each movie contained, and MPAA ratings, all on the basis of each movieâ€™s domestic gross.

## Summary

The highest grossing movies characteristics are:

1. G or PG-13 ratings
2. Genres of Science Fiction, Adventure, Action, Musical, Animation, Family, Fantasy
3. Contain 3-7 genres

Microsoft is well poised to take advantage of these characteristics with the intellectual properties it owns, such as Halo and Minecraft. These fit multiple genres listed above and would easily fit the MPAA ratings that are proven to be high revenue generators.
